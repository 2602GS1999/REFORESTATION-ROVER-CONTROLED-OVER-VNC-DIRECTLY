# REFORESTATION-ROVER-CONTROLED-OVER-VNC-DIRECTLY

This is the source code of the reforestation UGV, as you can see, it is directly controlled over VNC. This was later changed to SSH, as network was not as stable as I expected. 
The second rober was programmed to follow the first (there was a red circle printed behind the first rover, which the second rover detected).
All digging and plowing equipment were carried by the first rover, the second one was responsible for planting. 

COSMOS.py is the main program.
